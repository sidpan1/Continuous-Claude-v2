# Skills System

Skills are Claude Code's native format for reusable expert tools. Auto-discovered from this directory.

## What is a Skill?

A self-contained tool that:
- Defines trigger patterns (when to activate)
- Provides methodology (step-by-step instructions)
- Integrates with MCP tools
- Returns results or artifacts

## SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Brief description (max 1024 chars)
---

# My Skill

- **File context**: Files being viewed/edited

## Creating Skills

1. Create `.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`
2. Add to `skill-rules.json`:
```json
{
  "my-skill": {
    "promptTriggers": {
      "keywords": ["my feature"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Skills vs Agents

| Aspect | Skills | Agents |
